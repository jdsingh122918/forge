Let me provide a summary of what was implemented for Phase 08 - Pattern Learning Improvements.

## Summary

I have successfully implemented **Phase 08: Pattern Learning Improvements** for Forge. Here's what was added:

### 1. Phase Type Classification (`PhaseType` enum)

- **Location:** `src/patterns/mod.rs:42-110`
- Added `PhaseType` enum with variants: `Scaffold`, `Implement`, `Test`, `Refactor`, `Fix`
- Implemented `PhaseType::classify(phase_name)` that classifies phases based on name keywords
- Supports serialization/deserialization with serde

### 2. Enhanced `PhaseStat` Structure

- **Location:** `src/patterns/mod.rs:112-140`
- Added `phase_type: PhaseType` field for classification
- Added `exceeded_budget: bool` for tracking budget overruns
- Added `common_errors: Vec<String>` placeholder for error tracking
- File patterns are now populated from audit trail

### 3. `PhaseTypeStats` Aggregate Statistics

- **Location:** `src/patterns/mod.rs:142-185`
- Computes aggregate statistics by phase type:
  - `count`, `avg_iterations`, `min_iterations`, `max_iterations`
  - `avg_budget`, `success_rate`
- Added `Pattern::compute_type_stats()` and `Pattern::compute_common_file_patterns()` methods

### 4. Pattern Matching Algorithm

- **Location:** `src/patterns/mod.rs:855-940`
- Implemented `match_patterns(spec_content, patterns)` with similarity scoring
- Uses weighted combination of:
  - Tag overlap (40% weight)
  - Phase count similarity (30% weight)
  - Keyword similarity (30% weight)
- Returns sorted list of `PatternMatch` structs

### 5. Budget Suggestion Algorithm

- **Location:** `src/patterns/mod.rs:942-1058`
- Implemented `suggest_budgets(patterns, phases)` that suggests budgets based on historical data
- Returns `BudgetSuggestion` with confidence levels
- Aggregates data across multiple similar patterns

### 6. Skill Recommendations

- **Location:** `src/patterns/mod.rs:1120-1165`
- Added `recommend_skills_for_phase(phase_name, patterns)` function
- Recommends relevant skills based on phase type and file patterns

### 7. CLI Commands

- **Location:** `src/main.rs:101-124` (PatternsCommands enum)
- Added `forge patterns stats` - Shows aggregate statistics by phase type
- Added `forge patterns recommend [--spec <path>]` - Recommends patterns for a spec
- Added `forge patterns compare <pattern1> <pattern2>` - Compares two patterns

### 8. Generate Module Integration

- **Location:** `src/generate/mod.rs:322-408`
- Integrated pattern matching into `forge generate` workflow
- Shows similar patterns before generation
- Displays budget suggestions based on matched patterns

### 9. Comprehensive Tests

- Added 30+ new tests covering:
  - Phase type classification
  - Phase type statistics computation
  - Pattern matching algorithm
  - Budget suggestion algorithm
  - Skill recommendations
  - File pattern generalization

All **344 tests pass** and the code builds successfully with no warnings in the patterns module.
