The Hook System Core is now fully implemented. Let me provide a summary of what was built:

## Summary: Hook System Core (Phase 02)

### What was implemented:

1. **Hook Types and Events** (`src/hooks/types.rs`)
   - `HookEvent` enum: PrePhase, PostPhase, PreIteration, PostIteration, OnFailure, OnApproval
   - `HookType` enum: Command (implemented), Prompt (placeholder for phase 03)
   - `HookAction` enum: Continue, Block, Skip, Modify, Approve, Reject
   - `HookResult` struct with action, message, inject, and metadata
   - `HookContext` struct providing phase, iteration, file changes to hooks

2. **Hook Configuration** (`src/hooks/config.rs`)
   - `HookDefinition` struct with event, match pattern, command, timeout, etc.
   - `HooksConfig` struct for loading from `.forge/hooks.toml`
   - Pattern matching via glob patterns (e.g., `database-*`)
   - Validation of hook definitions

3. **Hook Executor** (`src/hooks/executor.rs`)
   - Command hook execution via subprocess
   - JSON context passed via stdin
   - Environment variables: FORGE_EVENT, FORGE_PHASE, FORGE_ITERATION
   - Exit code interpretation: 0=Continue, 1=Block, 2=Skip, 3=Approve, 4=Reject
   - JSON or plain text output parsing
   - Timeout handling

4. **Hook Manager** (`src/hooks/manager.rs`)
   - Main entry point for hook system
   - Loads hooks from configuration
   - Matches hooks to events and phases
   - Convenience methods: run_pre_phase, run_post_phase, run_pre_iteration, etc.

5. **Integration with forge.toml** (`src/forge_config.rs`)
   - Added `HooksSection` to ForgeToml
   - Hooks can be defined in either `hooks.toml` or `forge.toml`

6. **Integration into Orchestrator** (`src/main.rs`)
   - HookManager initialized at orchestrator start
   - Hooks from both hooks.toml and forge.toml merged
   - All lifecycle hooks called at appropriate points:
     - OnApproval: Before approval gate (can auto-approve/reject)
     - PrePhase: Before phase starts (can block/skip)
     - PreIteration: Before each Claude invocation
     - PostIteration: After each Claude response
     - OnFailure: When max iterations reached
     - PostPhase: After phase completes

### Usage Example:

**`.forge/hooks.toml`:**
```toml
[[hooks]]
event = "pre_phase"
match = "database-*"
command = "./scripts/ensure-db-running.sh"

[[hooks]]
event = "post_iteration"
command = "./scripts/check-progress.sh"
timeout_secs = 60
```

### Tests:
- 200 tests passing
- Comprehensive unit tests for all hook components
- Integration tests for hook execution and phase matching
