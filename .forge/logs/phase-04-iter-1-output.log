The implementation is complete. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: Skills and Templates System (Phase 04)

I have successfully implemented the Skills and Templates System for Forge. Here's what was created:

### New Files
- **`src/skills/mod.rs`** - Core skills module with:
  - `Skill` struct representing a loaded skill
  - `SkillsLoader` for loading and caching skills
  - Helper functions: `ensure_skills_directory()`, `create_skill()`, `delete_skill()`
  - 16 comprehensive unit tests

### Modified Files

1. **`src/lib.rs`** - Added `pub mod skills;` export

2. **`src/phase.rs`** - Added:
   - `skills: Vec<String>` field to `Phase` struct
   - `Phase::with_skills()` constructor for phases with skills

3. **`src/forge_config.rs`** - Added:
   - `SkillsSection` struct with `global` skills list
   - `skills` field in `PhaseOverride` for pattern-based skill overrides
   - `skills` field in `PhaseSettings` for resolved phase settings
   - Updated `phase_settings()` to merge global and phase-specific skills

4. **`src/orchestrator/runner.rs`** - Updated:
   - `generate_prompt()` to load and inject skills into prompts
   - Added `load_skills_for_phase()` helper method
   - 2 new tests for skills integration

5. **`src/init/mod.rs`** - Updated:
   - Created `.forge/skills/` directory on init
   - Updated documentation and tests

6. **`src/main.rs`** - Added:
   - `Skills` command with subcommands: `list`, `show`, `create`, `delete`
   - Full CLI interface for skill management

### Skill Structure
```
.forge/skills/
├── rust-conventions/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── testing-strategy/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── cli-design/
    └── SKILL.md
```

### Usage Examples

**Phase JSON with skills:**
```json
{
  "number": "03",
  "name": "API implementation",
  "skills": ["rust-conventions", "api-design"],
  "promise": "API COMPLETE"
}
```

**Global skills in forge.toml:**
```toml
[skills]
global = ["rust-conventions"]

[phases.overrides."database-*"]
skills = ["sql-conventions"]
```

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
forge skills list              # List all skills
forge skills show <name>       # View skill content
forge skills create <name>     # Create new skill
forge skills delete <name>     # Delete skill
```

### Test Results
- All 248 tests pass
- Release build succeeds
- CLI commands work correctly
